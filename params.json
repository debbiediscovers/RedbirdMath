Spearheaded by Professor Patrick Suppes, the university founded Stanford's Educational Program for Gifted Youth (EPGY) in the 1990s. Through EPGY, researchers at Stanford conducted in-depth studies on accelerated learning, and how emerging technologies could support each student's academic needs. This work became the foundation of EPGY's innovative computer-based, multimedia courses in Mathematics, English Language Arts, Science and Computer Programming specifically designed to help students become advanced learners. In developing these specialized online courses, and coupling them with support from expert tutors, the EPGY research team became pioneers in the field of personalized learning.\r\n\r\nAs the program matured, winning numerous scientific grants and awards, it became clear that Stanford had developed a powerful set of tools that could accelerate, and deepen, the learning of many students. In 2013, Stanford selected Redbird Advanced Learning to modernize the technology behind EPGY and make the courses accessible to a broader set of students worldwide via GiftedandTalented.com.\r\n\r\nFollowing the model of innovative programs like Google and SUN Microsystems, which grew out of research at Stanford to impact millions, Stanford began looking for the right company to broaden the impact of its proven program. Stanford sought innovators who could bring the technical savvy, educational expertise, and corporate means necessary to make Professor Suppes’ vision a broadly adopted reality.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, Stanford selected [Redbird Advanced Learning] (http://redbirdlearning.com) to co-develop and offer the next generation of its acclaimed, adaptive digital curriculum and blended learning implementation programs. Granted an exclusive, perpetual license to the university’s K – 12 online learning programs, and guided by a formal, commitment to continuing Stanford research, Redbird is building on the distinguished Stanford EPGY legacy. \r\n\r\n\r\n##About Redbird Advanced Learning##\r\n\r\nRedbird Advanced Learning offers educators unprecedented tools and resources for personalized classroom instruction, combining cutting-edge technology with groundbreaking ongoing research at Stanford University.
